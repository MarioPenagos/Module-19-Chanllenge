## Issue and Solution

**Issue:**
Used ChatGPT to address an error in the `send_transaction` code. I encountered an error due to setting the gas price to `0`, which caused issues. Additionally, the `signTransaction` method needed to be added to the function.

**Solution:**
The `send_transaction` function was adjusted to set the gas price correctly and to use the appropriate method for signing the transaction.

## Transactions

Took the following transactions, all under the images subfolder:
